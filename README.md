# Convolutional-Neural-Network

This repository contains two datasets and their respective Notebooks for testing and training models.

"Vehicle_Data" model is not very accurate and I have created different models by changing values like image size and epochs.
You may train or test any of these models.

"dataset" model is much better compared to above model.
I have trained only one model for this dataset. You are free to test or train it.

## Configuration:
Related files have same starting name. For example, all files involved in "dataset" training data have starting name with "dataset_filename". Further more, "dataset" is having only 4 files. A folder consisting of data for training and testing, training data (notebook), testing data (notebook) and a saved model (h5).

## Usage:
I have worked on the files in Google Colab.
Import the repository folder in "CNN" folder (create it in your drive) and paste content of repo there.
You'll be able to work on the files in Google Colab.
