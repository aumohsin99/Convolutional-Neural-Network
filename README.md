# Convolutional-Neural-Network

This repository contains two datasets and their respective Notebooks for testing and training models.

"Vehicle_Data" model is not very accurate and I have created different models by changing values like image size and epochs.
You may train or test any of these models.

"dataset" model is much better compared to above model.
I have trained only one model for this dataset. You are free to test or train it.
